# simple-spy

A simple spy library for Clojure.

## Usage

Include in your project:

    [baritonehands/simple-spy "0.1.0"]

Require in your Clojure namespace:

```clojure
(ns com.example.your-application
  (:require [baritonehands.simple-spy :as spy]))
```

Create a spy:

```clojure
(def my-fn (spy/create {:foo "bar"})) ;Constantly return a single value
(def my-fn (spy/create (fn [& more] ...) ;Provide a custom implementation to be called
```


List the calls:

```clojure
(my-fn 1 2 3)
(my-fn)
(my-fn :a :b :c)

(spy/calls my-fn)
=> [(1 2 3) (:a :b :c) nil]
```


Verify your spec:

```clojure
(spy/verify my-fn 1 2 3) ;Returns number of calls
=> 1

(spy/verify my-fn number? even? odd?) ;Also accepts predicates
=> 1

(spy/verify my-fn 3 string? (every-pred odd? keyword?)) ;Something definitely false throws
AssertionError 
No matching call found:
  Expected: (3 string? (every-pred odd? keyword?))
  Calls: (1 2 3), (:a :b :c), ()
```
